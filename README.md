# Hacker News Clone

## Overview

This project is a clone of Hacker News built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The aim was to replicate the core functionalities of Hacker News while learning to make quick decisions in the development process.

## Features Implemented

- **Header with Logo**: A clean header that includes the logo for brand identity.
- **News Feed**: Displaying all items in a grid layout, matching the UI and styling of the original Hacker News.
- **Responsive Design**: Utilized Tailwind CSS for its flexibility in inline styling, ensuring a responsive and modern look.

## Getting Started

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
2. Start the development server:
      ```bash
   npm run dev

### Limitations of the Implementation

- **Interactivity**: The application lacks full interactive capabilities, such as upvoting articles and navigating through top nav buttons, which limits user engagement.

- **URL Abbreviation Logic**: The implementation is not comprehensive; it only addresses `github.com` URLs effectively. Other URLs may not be processed correctly or may display inconsistently.

- **Type Checking**: The absence of thorough type checking could lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior when fetching and displaying data.
